    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    
    <ul>Meat: This super meaty lasagna has sweet Italian sausage and lean ground beef.</ul>
    
    <ul>Onion and garlic: An onion and two cloves of garlic are cooked with the meat to add tons of flavor.</ul>
    
    <ul>Tomato products: You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.</ul>
    
    <ul>Sugar: Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness and enhance the flavor of the sauce.</ul>
    
    <ul>Spices and seasonings: This lasagna recipe is flavored with fresh parsley, dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and black pepper.</ul>
    
    <ul>Lasagna noodles: Use store-bought or homemade lasagna noodles.</ul>

    <ul>Cheeses: Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make this lasagna extra decadent.</ul>

    <ul>Egg: An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze out of the lasagna when you cut into it.</ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    
    <ol><li>FIRST, chop up sandwich bread, the soak in grated onion. This is a secret tip for ultra soft, extra tasty meatballs. Grating onion = no need to pan fry chopped onion AND extracts onion juices which soaks the bread, which later puffs up inside the meatballs as they cook, creating ultra soft meatballs!</li>
    
    
        <li>Boil pasta: Cook in a large pot of salted water per the recipe below.</li>
    
    <li>Prepare meat sauce: Cook sausage and beef with onion and garlic. Drain well, add the pasta sauce & simmer it for a few minutes to thicken.</li>
    
    <li>Combine cheese mixture: Stir the cheese mixture together in a bowl.</li>
    
    <li>Layer & bake: Layer the meat sauce and cheese mixture with lasagna noodles and bake until browned and bubbly</li></ol>
